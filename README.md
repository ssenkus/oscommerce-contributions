========================

A small collection of custom osCommerce contributions that I wrote!

nomfr.php 
---------
A simple backend database query that helped the manager find products without a manufacturer.
A table of products with direct product editing links to help expedite the process is created.
The version of osCommerce used on the site was fairly outdated and the products missing a manufacturer weren't showing up correctly under the product listings.  

ppmo.php
----------------
The store manager needed to have a TSV file prepared to upload recent orders to the Paypal Multi Order Shipping. 
This script was based off of an outdated CSV file generator.
Users can select the range of dates to output
